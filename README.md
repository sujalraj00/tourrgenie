 ## 🧠 The Problem: Why Travel Planning is Broken
 
 - **Fragmented Logistics**: 6+ apps to plan a trip? Nah, we’re not doing that.
 - **Language Barriers**: 72% of travelers face comm issues abroad (Phocuswright Report).
 - **Solo Travel Loneliness**: Finding safe, like-minded group activities is hard af.
 - **Trust & Payment Friction**: Hidden fees, currency conversions, fraud risks... ew.
